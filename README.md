## Web-based application for automatic HVAC system ##

Web-based application for an automatic HVAC system in CC3 building that aims to provide thermal comfort and improve the indoor air quality. Based on the environment inside the building the system should be able to automatically adjust the temperature with the help of ACs, fans, heaters, etc., create the ventilation for the air to refresh it after regular intervals of time to maintain the air quality. The input sensor data involves the temperature, humidity and air quality. The air quality can be measured in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI) values ranging from 0 to 500 degrees based on the presence of pollutants, refer below figure for standard benchmarks. On the basis of the sensed data we can adjust the temperature and ventilation accordingly, which also lead to efficient management of energy.

### Product Perspective
In a building workspace, temperature and air quality matters a lot ,its concerns with the health of employees working on , thus maintenance and working of HVAC at its best is of most need,thus need of our application in turn reduces the manual effort for the same by automatically updating the HVAC,This is a self contained product,the product involves sensors to monitor the condition in the surrounding.

### Product Functions
The major function of our product is to control the environment situations inside the CC3 building. It mainly collects the data from the sensor of environmental conditions and translates them in the ways to be used by the HVAC system and then our product will provide the output according to the conditions.

Some major function of the product are listed below:-

- Taking input from the sensor in the automatic mode.
- Update the HVAC by taking necessary actions based on the input.
- Taking input from the user in the manual mode.
- Showing output given by the implemented Automation HVAC system to the user.
- Send an alert message and pop up, if conditions cross the threshold.
- Keep a record of the HVAC performance.
